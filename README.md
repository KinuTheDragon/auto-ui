# Auto UI: An automatic UI generator

## Usage

Simply `import aui` and then use `aui.make_app(src_filename, commands_filename, icon_filename)`.
If you want, you can `exec` this right away, or simply write it to a file.
If this is the case, make sure that you can access the `blank.png` file which is automatically loaded.
